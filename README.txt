Integrate your site's content with the Public Media Platform.

== Description ==

The [Public Media Platform](http://publicmediaplatform.org) is a cross-media distribution system for digital content (audio, video, stories, and images).  You can use it both to bring additional public media produced content to your site, and to expand the reach of your content to external web and mobile destinations.

The PMP was founded by a collaboration of APM, NPR, PBS, PRI and PRX, with the goal of bringing public media content to a wider audience.  It contains more than 300K pieces of digital content from our founding partners, and is growing every day.  For more information on what's available, feel free to [search the PMP](https://support.pmp.io/search?profile=story&has=image).

Built by the [INN Nerds](http://nerds.inn.org/).
